1) how we can create our custom laravel log files 
After some digging around I found that I could add a channel to config/logging.php like this

'customlog' => [
            'driver' => 'single',
            'path' => storage_path('logs/custom.log'),
            'level' => 'info',
],
and write to it like this

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
Log::channel('customlog')->info('Hello world!!');
